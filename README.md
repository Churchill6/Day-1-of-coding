# Day-1-of-coding

### Start of my coding journey

I am a **beginner** in web development and i‘m very excited to start my coding journey.
Today, I will be trying to come up with my very first ever code. I‘m up for it and 
really hope that I get it done. In doing this, i will use the following;
#### GifHub
#### Markdown

In Web development,I wish to learn a few things that could help me in my future career 
aspirations.Some of these include;
- Programming
- Quality testing
- Javascript
- Data analysis

With those and few more, I can then be able to find my way into becoming one of the 
following;
1. Front-end developer
2. Back-end developer
3. Full-stack developer

If you wish to learn these as well, join me at Beam Institute (http://beaminstitute.org)
